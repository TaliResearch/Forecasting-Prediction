What is a Kalman Filter?
The Kalman filter is an algorithm that uses noisy observations of a system over time to estimate 
the parameters of the system (some of which are unobservable) and predict future observations. 
At each time step, it makes a prediction, takes in a measurement, and updates itself based 
on how the prediction and measurement compare.
