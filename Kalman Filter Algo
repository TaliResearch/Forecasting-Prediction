What is a Kalman Filter?
The Kalman filter is an algorithm that uses noisy observations of a system over time to estimate 
the parameters of the system (some of which are unobservable) and predict future observations. 
At each time step, it makes a prediction, takes in a measurement, and updates itself based 
on how the prediction and measurement compare.

The algorithm is as follows:
1.	Take as input a mathematical model of the system, i.e.
•	the transition matrix, which tells us how the system evolves from one state to another. 
For instance, if we are modeling the movement of a car, then the next values of position
and velocity can be computed from the previous ones using kinematic equations. 
Alternatively, if we have a system which is fairly stable, we might model its 
evolution as a random walk. If you want to read up on Kalman filters, note that 
this matrix is usually called A. 

•	the observation matrix, which tells us the next measurement we should expect 
given the predicted next state. If we are measuring the position of the car,
we just extract the position values stored in the state. For a more complex example, 
consider estimating a linear regression model for the data. Then our state is the 
coefficients of the model, and we can predict the next measurement 
from the linear equation. This is denoted H
•	any control factors that affect the state transitions but are not part of the measurements. For instance, if our car were falling, gravity would be a control factor. If the noise does not have mean 0, it should be shifted over and the offset put into the control factors. The control factors are summarized in a matrix � with time-varying control vector ��, which give the offset ���.
•	covariance matrices of the transition noise (i.e. noise in the evolution of the system) and measurement noise, denoted � and �, respectively.
